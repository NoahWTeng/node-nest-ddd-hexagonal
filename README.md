DDD: Part I (Introduction)

1. What Is DDD All About?
To start this section, I’d rather take the definition from one of DDD’s communities, dddcommunity.org, that describes DDD as an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts.
As the definition implies, DDD is suitable for you if you’re building software that has complexity in its business process (business domain). So, not every software is suitable for DDD (e.g. CRUD applications aren't suitable for it since they're not very complex).
Teamwork is very important within DDD since you need to keep in touch with the users/clients (a.k.a Domain Experts). Moreover, you build the software for them, not for you (you got the point right). Just like someone said: “the software can fail either in two ways, you build the things wrong or you build the wrong things.” In that case, you have to ensure that you understand the business that you’re going to build. This is what DDD is all about.
To summarize, DDD can be described as a technique for developing software that focuses on collaboration between technical experts and domain experts. Therefore, we must keep focus with the domain experts instead of the nitty-gritty details of the technical stuff.
